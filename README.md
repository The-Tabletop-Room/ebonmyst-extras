A companion module for the Tabletop Room's homebrew Pathfinder 2E game. This module is not intended to be used outside of The Tabletop Room and it's associated games, while nothing should break use at your own risk. It has been provided as an open repo for the interest of out players.

## Ebonmyst

:beginner: Ebonmyst is a beginner friendly homebrew for Pathfinder 2E. Starting at first level and climbing from there.

:electric_plug: Macros - Custom macros to aid in gameplay for the DM and/or players.

## To-Do
